title: Sort of Waldorf

I recently received in the post my annual delivery of cobnuts from Allen's Farm in Kent. In late autumn, they have a wonderful, golden-maroon husk, and are easy and delicious to crack and eat as a snack. Stored in a sealed container, they should keep for a couple of months. Cobnuts have a fresher flavour than any other nut I know of, and go very well with autumnal fruit and light cheeses. Here, I roast them very slowly to make them totally crunchy and enhance their flavourtitle: Normal hazelnuts make a perfectly fine substitute. Serves six to eight.

* 100g cobnuts, shelled weight
* ½ red cabbage (about 300g), finely shredded
* 4 celery stalks (350g), cut into 5mm thick slices
* 2 Granny Smith apples, thinly sliced
* ½ medium red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
* 160g soured cream
* 50g dill, finely chopped
* 100g dried sour cherries (or cranberries), optional
* Salt and black pepper
* For the mayonnaise
* 1 small shallot, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 egg yolk
* 1 tsp Dijon mustard
* 1 tsp maple syrup
* 1 tbsp cider vinegar
* 90ml sunflower oil
* 90ml rapeseed oil

Preheat the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Scatter the cobnuts in an ovenproof dish and roast for 30 minutes, or until they take on some colour and are dry and crisp. Remove, set aside to cool down, then crush roughly.

Put the shallot, egg yolk, mustard, maple, vinegar and half a teaspoon of salt in a small bowl. Whisk, then add the oils in a slow stream, whisking all the time, until you have a smooth, thick mayonnaise. Set aside.

Put the cabbage, celery, apples and onion in a large mixing bowl. Add the soured cream, dill, mayo, sour cherries (if using), and some salt and black pepper. Use your hands to mix everything together thoroughly (don't mind if you break the apple slices; it's all part of the look). Taste and adjust the seasoning accordingly, transfer to individual plates and scatter nuts on top before serving.
