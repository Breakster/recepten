title: Spinach with Chickpeas
---
Serves 6

The combination of spinach with chickpeas is common throughout the Middle East, but the flavors here are Egyptian. You may use good-quality canned chickpeas. It is good served with yogurt.

* 1/2 cup chickpeas, soaked overnight, or a 14-ounce can cooked chickpeas
* Salt
* 2 pounds spinach
* 4-6 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Pepper
* Juice of 1 lemon (optional)

If you are using the dried and soaked chickpeas, drain and boil them in fresh water for 1 1/4 hours, or until very tender, adding salt when they begin to soften.
Wash the spinach and remove stems only if they are thick and tough, then drain well.
In a large pan, fry the garlic and coriander in the oil, stirring, until the aroma rises. Pack in the spinach without adding any water, cover with a lid, and put over low heat until the leaves crumple to a soft mass. Add the drained chickpeas—cooked or canned—season with a little salt and pepper, mix very well, and cook a few minutes more. If there is too much liquid, reduce a little on high heat.
Serve hot or cold, with a squeeze of lemon if you like.
Variations
Fry 1 large chopped onion in 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add 2 medium peeled and chopped tomatoes and 1 teaspoon sugar and cook until
reduced, then stir in the cooked spinach and the chickpeas.
White haricot or navy beans may be used instead of chickpeas.
