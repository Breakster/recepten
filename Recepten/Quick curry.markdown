title: Quick curry
---

This is an easy recipe for a curry sauce which you can make into whatever sort of curry you like. The last time I made it I used a drained tin of chick peas to make it a veggie curry and it worked well. The previous time I used chicken and it was just as good. So it's up to you. The recipe makes enough sauce for 2 generous servings.

# Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 medium onion - finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic - finely chopped
* 6-10 dried Bird's Eye chillies - whole (I use 10 which makes a hot curry)
* 2 whole cardamon pods
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin seed
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander seed
* half teaspoon dry ginger powder
* half teaspoon turmeric
* half teaspoon concentrated tomato puree
* salt to taste
* 1 teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves washed in a sieve and left moist for 10 minutes (optional, but they do give the curry that elusive "restaurant" taste)

# Method
Heat the oil over a highish heat and add the onions. Stir fry for a few minutes then add the chillies and cardamons and fry for a few more minutes until the spices have increased in size. Add the garlic, stir, turn the heat down to low and cook for 10 minutes (or longer if you've got the time). Add the cumin, coriander, ginger and turmeric and leave to fry over a low heat for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add about 10 fl.oz. hot water, the tomato puree and the salt and leave to simmer for 30 minutes. If you are using chicken then add it now, cut into bite size pieces. Stir the sauce from time to time and add a little hot water if necessary. If you are using the fenugreek leaves add them 10 minutes before the end of the cooking. If you are making a chick pea curry add them now too. At the end of the cooking there should be hardly any liquid left just a thick, hot sauce.
