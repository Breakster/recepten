For a pieform with a diameter of 24 cm
Preheat the oven to 200-225 C
place the rack in the bottom of the oven
Baking time: 50-60 minutes
Afterwards 20 minutes with bottom heating

Preheat the oven in time. Cover the baking form with butter. Put flour, caster
sugar, butter, salt and vanilla sugar in a bowl. With two knifes, cut the
butter into tiny pieces through the flour. Add 3/4 of the egg. Knead the
ingredients with cool hands until you have a solid ball that doesn't stick to
the bowl. Keep 1/4 of the dough for the cover. Push half of the remaining part
of the dough on the bottom of the form. Of the other half, make two rolls that
have the length of the circumference of the form. Push them onto the bottom of
the pie and make an edge of 4cm high. Of the remaining part of the dough, make
14 rolls (1/2 cm thick) of diminishing length, to put on top of the filling. It
is also possible to roll out the dough in a 3mm thick sheet and cut it into
strips, instead of rolls. Put the dough in the form in a cool place.

Put the lemon juice in a bowl. Peel the apples, cut them into quarters, remove
the cores and cut them into slices. Put them into the bowl immideately and mix
them with the lemon juice and lemon peel. Mix them with the sugar, cinnamon,
raisins, currants, almonds and custardpowder. Cover the bottom with
breadcrumbs. Fill the the dough in the form with the apple mixture. Make sure
that the middle is a little higher. With a fork, push the top of the edge of
the pie flat and put the prepared rolls on top of the filling to form diamond
shapes. With a fork, push the ends of the rolls onto the edge of the pie to fix
them. Cover the rolls with the remaining part of the egg.

Put the form in the bottom of preheated oven. Bake the apple pie in the
indicated time until it is brown and done. Leave the pie in the form to cool,
until the edge is firm. Remove the edge of the form. Leave to cool until firm.
