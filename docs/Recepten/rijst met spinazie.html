Rice dishes feature in a big way in miniatures depicting the feasts and banquets of the Turkish Ottoman Sultans, and one researcher found mentions of 100 in the archives of Topkapi in Istanbul. Yogurt makes a good accompaniment to this simple and delightful one.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 pound fresh spinach</li>
<li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
<li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups long-grain rice 2V4 cups water or chicken stock</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Wash and drain the spinach, and remove only tough stems. Cut it coarsely or leave it whole.
Fry the onion in 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pan till soft.
Add the rice and stir well. Then add the water or stock, salt and pepper, and the spinach. Stir and cook, covered, on very low heat for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Stir in the remaining oil.
Serve hot or cold. Accompany with yogurt, beaten, if you like, with crushed garlic.</p>
